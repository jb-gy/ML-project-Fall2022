# Machine Learning Project: NYC Vehicle Accidents Analysis (2016-2022)

### Team Members:
- **Ajibola Ganiyu**
- **Madison Davis**

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing the **“Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes.csv”** dataset, which contains data on vehicle accidents in New York City from **2016 to 2022**. The primary goal was to explore patterns and develop a predictive model to gain insights into vehicle accident occurrences.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Dataset Exploration and Cleaning
The original dataset consisted of **over a million records**, making it necessary to filter and clean the data to ensure accurate analysis. 
- We reduced the dataset to **154,000 records** by removing irrelevant, duplicate, or incomplete entries, ensuring the quality of the data used for modeling.
- **Techniques used:** 
  - Data filtering
  - Null value handling
  - Data type conversions

### 2. Data Analysis and Visualization
After cleaning the data, we conducted **thorough data exploration** to identify patterns, trends, and potential predictors for accident occurrences.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** 
  - Frequency of accidents by borough and time of year
  - Correlation analysis between weather conditions, time of day, and accident severity
- **Visualization:**
  - Created insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** to highlight the distribution of accidents, accident causes, and severity.

### 3. Model Development
We developed a **predictive model** using the **scikit-learn** library to anticipate future accident occurrences based on key features such as time, location, and weather conditions. 
- **Modeling Techniques:**
  - Data preparation and feature scaling
  - Model selection and training
  - Model evaluation and tuning
- **Key Result:** Achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting accident severity using a decision tree classifier and random forest model.

### 4. Project Presentation
We presented our findings to the class, showcasing:
- Key trends and correlations identified in the data
- The steps we took to clean, filter, and analyze the dataset
- The results of our predictive model and its potential real-world applications in improving road safety in NYC

### 5. Teamwork and Collaboration
As a team, we demonstrated excellent collaboration throughout the project, dividing tasks and aligning regularly to meet key milestones. Our success was largely due to:
- **Effective communication**: Constant coordination using GitHub for version control and regular sync-ups to track progress.
- **Strong teamwork**: Seamless integration of our efforts to deliver high-quality analysis and presentation.
